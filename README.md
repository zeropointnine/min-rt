Rudimentary CPU-based raytracing library written in Rust, using the pseudocode outlined in the book ["Computer Graphics from Scratch"](https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/) by Gabriel Gambetta. 

Currently up to and including the section on shadows and reflections. Work in progress.

To run an example, `cd` to a subdirectory in `/examples/`, and enter `cargo run`.
