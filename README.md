Rudimentary CPU-based raytracing library written in Rust, using the pseudocode outlined in the book ["Computer Graphics from Scratch"](https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/) by Gabriel Gambetta. 

Currently working through the beginning of the chapter, "Extending the Raytracer".

Beyond the scope of the book, the library also includes:
- Multi-threading support
- An ANSI TrueColor console output mode
- A YAML scene generator/parser

To run an example, `cd` to a subdirectory within `/examples`, and enter `cargo run`.
